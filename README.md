# Discover-Financial-Services-Internships

During my internships at Discover Financial Services in 2023 and 2024, I had the opportunity to work extensively on ServiceNow. 

Initially, I was a part of the SACM team, where I gained valuable experience in understanding and managing the infrastructure aspect of ServiceNow. This experience laid a strong foundation for my skills in IT service management and configuration management databases (CMDB). 

In 2024, I retured to Discover to work on the ServiceNow Platform team, where I deepened my knowledge by focusing on platform customization and development. 

Through these experiences, I acquired a comprehensive skill set in ServiceNow, including workflow automation, catalog item creation, and integration with other systems. My time at Discover has been instrumental in enhancing my technical and problem-solving skills, and I am excited to continue building on this foundation.
